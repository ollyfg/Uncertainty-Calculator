Uncertainty-Calculator
======================

A HTML calculator that deals with uncertainties for you

You can use this calculator much like a normal calculator, except one can enter uncertainties in value too, by using the &plusmn; button. All of the math dealing with the propagation of errors is handled for you behind the scene, simplifying calculations involving errors significantly.

This calculator can also round your final answer down to the correct number of significant figures in both the value and the error.

The calculator can be found [here](http://ollyfg.github.io/Uncertainty-Calculator "Uncertainty Calculator").
